# INTERACTIVE-QUIZ-APPLICATION

*COMPANY*: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: SANGISHETTY SIRI

*INTERN ID*:CT04DN800

*DOMAIN*: FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH 

In the first week of creating my Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I focused on planning the layout, structure, and design of the entire project. This week was very important because a well-planned design makes the development process easier and helps avoid confusion later. My goal was to create a simple, user-friendly quiz app that looks good and works well on both computers and mobile phones. The Interactive Quiz Application is a simple yet effective web-based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to test their knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. It features a clean, responsive design where questions and answer options are dynamically displayed. Upon selecting an answer, users receive instant feedback indicating whether their choice was correct or incorrect, with visual cues and a message. The app also includes a "Next" button to navigate through the quiz, and upon completion, it displays a final message or score. This project demonstrates key front-end development skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interface design, making it an excellent beginner-friendly project for learning interactive webÂ development.

During development, I implemented key front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation to dynamically update quiz content, event handling to respond to user clicks, and conditional logic to manage answer validation and score tracking. I also ensured that the application maintains a clear separation of concerns by keeping the structure, styling, and logic in their respective files. One of the most important aspects of this task was ensuring responsiveness, so I used flexible layout techniques and media queries to make the interface mobile-friendly. Through this task, I gained practical experience in building a fully functional web application from scratch, improved my understanding of user interface design, and enhanced my problem-solving skills by debugging and refining the code. Overall, this project served as a strong introduction to interactive web development, providing a hands-on opportunity to apply my knowledge of front-end technologies and laying a solid foundation for more complex features in the upcoming weeks of the internship.
