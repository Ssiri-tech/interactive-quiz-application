In the first week of creating my Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I focused on planning the layout, structure, and design of the entire project. This week was very important because a well-planned design makes the development process easier and helps avoid confusion later. My goal was to create a simple, user-friendly quiz app that looks good and works well on both computers and mobile phones. The Interactive Quiz Application is a simple yet effective web-based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to test their knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. It features a clean, responsive design where questions and answer options are dynamically displayed. Upon selecting an answer, users receive instant feedback indicating whether their choice was correct or incorrect, with visual cues and a message. The app also includes a "Next" button to navigate through the quiz, and upon completion, it displays a final message or score. This project demonstrates key front-end development skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interface design, making it an excellent beginner-friendly project for learning interactive webÂ development.
